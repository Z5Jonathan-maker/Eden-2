# Eden v1.0 - Product Scope & Boundaries

## 1. What Eden Does (Core Value Proposition)
Eden is an AI-powered operating system for Public Adjusting firms. It unifies claims management, field operations, and client communication into a single, opinionated workflow.

### Core Pillars:
*   **Claims Lifecycle Management**: From lead (Harvest) to settlement (Claims).
*   **Field Operations**: Gamified canvassing, territory management, and inspection tracking.
*   **AI-Assisted Workflow**: "Adam" acts as a force multiplier for adjusters (not a replacement).
*   **Client Transparency**: Real-time portals for clients to track their claim status.

## 2. What Eden Does NOT Do (Out of Scope for v1.0)
*   **Accounting / General Ledger**: We are not QuickBooks. We track payments, but not P&L.
*   **Legal Case Management**: We hand off to attorneys; we do not manage litigation dockets.
*   **Generic CRM**: We are not Salesforce. We manage *claims leads*, not generic sales pipelines.
*   **Xactimate Replacement**: We store estimates; we do not write them (yet).

## 3. Who Eden is For (Ideal Customer Profile)
*   **Public Adjusting Firms**: Teams of 3-50 adjusters.
*   **Growth-Focused Leaders**: Owners who want visibility and efficiency.
*   **Tech-Forward Adjusters**: Users willing to adopt mobile apps and AI tools.

## 4. Who Eden is NOT For
*   **Insurance Carriers**: We build for the policyholder side, never the carrier.
*   **Contractors / Roofers**: While related, our workflow is specific to PA regulations (F.S. 627).
*   **Solo Hobbyists**: Eden is built for teams and scaling operations.

## 5. Key Constraints & Opinions
*   **Mobile-First Field Work**: Canvassing happens on the phone, not the desktop.
*   **State-Driven Process**: Workflows enforce Florida Statutes (e.g., communication timelines).
*   **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are strict (Admins vs. Adjusters vs. View-Only).

# 🚀 Deployment Complete!

**Eden 2 is now live on the internet!**

You have successfully:
1.  Deployed the Python FastAPI Backend to **Render**.
2.  Deployed the React Frontend to **Vercel**.
3.  Connected them securely with **MongoDB Atlas**.

## How to Test Your Live App:
1.  Go to `https://eden2-five.vercel.app`
2.  **Login**: Use your test credentials (e.g., `test@eden.com` / `password`).
    *   *Note: The first request might take 30-50 seconds because Render's free tier "spins down" when inactive. Be patient!*
3.  **Check Data**: You should see your dashboard and claims.

## What's Next?
*   **Custom Domain**: You can buy `edenclaims.com` and connect it in Vercel settings.
*   **Monitoring**: Check Render logs if anything acts weird.
*   **New Features**: You can now code locally, push to GitHub, and Vercel/Render will **automatically** update your live site!

**Great work today. You built and deployed a complex full-stack app!** 👏👏👏

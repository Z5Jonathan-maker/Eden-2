# Reset Password to "password123"

I see the user `z5jonathan_db_user` exists! The issue is likely a mismatch between the password in the code and the one in Atlas.

## Please follow these exact steps to sync them:

1.  In your browser (where the screenshot is from), click the **Edit** button next to `z5jonathan_db_user`.
2.  Click **Edit Password**.
3.  Type exactly: `password123`
4.  Click **Update User**.

**Once you have clicked "Update User", tell me "Done" and I will restart the server.**

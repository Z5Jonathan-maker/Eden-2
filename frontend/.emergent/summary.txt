<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to transform the Eden application into a unified performance OS called Operation Eden. This requires a complete, app-wide aesthetic overhaul to a high-fidelity, AAA video game-level interface. Key requirements include:
*   A consistent, dark, tactical theme across every component.
*   Replacing all static icons and badges with high-quality, 3D-rendered artwork that has **truly transparent backgrounds** and drop shadows for a seamless, premium look.
*   Animating the entire application (top to bottom) with effects like spinning, glowing, pulsing, and fade-ins to make the UI feel alive.
*   Adding a document upload feature for the Agent Eve AI assistant to review and process files.
*   Removing an undesired green status bar from the main UI.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application has been significantly updated to align with the Operation Eden vision. Most pages now have a consistent Tactical Ops dark theme. A document upload feature has been successfully implemented for Agent Eve, including a frontend interface in  and a backend endpoint .

Crucially, a Python script () has been created and used with the  library to programmatically remove backgrounds from all AI-generated icons and badges. These processed images with true transparency are now stored locally in  and referenced in .

A suite of CSS animations (, , , ) has been added to . These animations and the new transparent icons have been applied to the  as a proof-of-concept. The undesired green status bar has been removed from the main .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing the user's request to animate the whole thing top to bottom. It had just finished processing ALL icon assets to have transparent backgrounds, updated  to use these new local assets, and added a variety of CSS animations to . The immediate next step is to apply these new assets and animations across the rest of the application beyond the landing page.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N (Testing was done on previous changes, but not on the app-wide animation implementation).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:

    -   **Where to resume:** The new transparent icons are in  and  is updated. New animation classes are in . The next step is to systematically go through all major components (, , , , etc.) and apply these animations and transparent icons to fulfill the user's top to bottom request. For example, make the Battle Pass tier badges glow or pulse.

-   **Recurrence count:** 5+
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED (Mitigated with a stable workaround).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Programmatic Image Processing:** Using the  Python library to automate the removal of backgrounds from a batch of image assets, ensuring true transparency.
-   **CSS Animations:** Extensive use of  and animation properties to create a dynamic, alive user interface with effects like floating, glowing, spinning, and pulsing.
-   **Local Asset Management:** Switched from referencing cloud-hosted image URLs to serving processed, transparent images from the local  directory for better control and performance.
-   **File Uploads (React/FastAPI):** Implemented a standard file upload pattern with  on the frontend and  on the FastAPI backend.

**key DB schema**
-   No schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
-   ****: Python library added for background removal.

**All files of reference**
-    (Contains the new CSS animations).
-    (Source of truth for all transparent icon paths).
-    (Directory containing the processed transparent images).
-    (All components here are targets for adding animations).
-    (Contains the new doc upload feature).
-    (Contains the new doc upload endpoint).
-    (The script used for image processing).
-   

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The Battle Pass data is currently hardcoded in . This should be moved to the database for persistence.
-   The old  component should be removed.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Retrieves Battle Pass data.
-   : (New) Uploads a document for Agent Eve to process.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your top priority is to apply animations and the new transparent icons across the ENTIRE application.** The user explicitly asked for the whole app to be animated top to bottom. The  is the template for this.
-   Use the animation classes now available in  (e.g., , , ).
-   Use the transparent icons now available via  and located in .
-   Systematically edit components like , , and  to incorporate these visual enhancements. For instance, make tier badges in the Battle Pass glow, or make sidebar icons subtly pulse.
-   The user is very particular about aesthetics. The goal is a premium, seamless AAA game feel. No more square backgrounds.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Animate the badges and features, make the landing page fade in/out and look alive. Also, all badges/icons must be transparent. (Concise summary of Msg 232) - **Status: In Progress**.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **image_generation_tool:** ✅ ACTIVE - Used to generate the initial set of icons.

-   **Admin:**  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent initially forgot to remove the backgrounds from all icons, specifically the pricing tier badges. The user pointed this out, and the agent corrected this by creating a new script () to process every icon mentioned in . The next step, applying the animations app-wide, is the logical continuation of the user's latest request and is now the primary pending task.</analysis>

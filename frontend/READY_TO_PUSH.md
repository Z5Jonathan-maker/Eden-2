# Ready to Push!

I have successfully committed the necessary configuration files to your local git repository.

## Final Step: Push to GitHub

You just need to run this command in your terminal to sync the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

Once pushed, you can follow the [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](file:///C:/Users/HP/Documents/trae_projects/eden%202/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) to connect Vercel and Render!

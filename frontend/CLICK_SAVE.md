# Final Step: Click "Edit User"

I updated the password in your settings to `8f6glk4HSexJL77H` (matching your screenshot).

## You must click the button in your screenshot!

1.  In that popup window in your browser ("Edit User: z5jonathan_db_user@admin").
2.  Click the green **Edit User** button at the bottom right.
    *(You might need to scroll down slightly to see it)*.

**If you don't click that button, the password is not saved, and we can't connect.**

Once you click it, tell me "Done"!
